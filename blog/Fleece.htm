<p>Corporate owned government politics. Have complete domininant control of all media outlets, degenerate into fear tactics. 
Spread negative influence using false information, and discriminate against the intelligent. </p>
<p>As sponsored gremlins announce omen obscure attention away from reason for profit and ill-gotten gains. 
Creating a placebo diseaase effect intentionally more damaging especially to mental health.</p>
	
<p>Going back in history, the discovery and use of Electricity, Radio, Telephone, TV, Cell Phones, Computers, and Internet!
Easily allows full control of all media outlets by a few corrupt corporations.
	</p>

<p>In recent past they fought hard and defeated the mobs, the nazies, social and economic oppression, and forced labor. 
Put in place laws to break monopolies, to prevent economic slavery, to prevent these from occurring.</p>
	
<p>Todays Capitalism/Communism "SCAMILISM", have become mostly opposites of same coin. 
Have became powerful hegemonic pyramid political systems and control for profits disregarding hurting everyone.
These political coin based systems probably began with the first civilizations, and are not compatible in the current age of electronics revolution.</p>
