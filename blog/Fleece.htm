<div class="">
<p>Corporate owned politics, domininant control of media outlets, degenerate into fear tactics. 
Spread negative influence using false information, discriminate against the intelligent. </p>
<p>As sponsored advrertisers obscure attention away from reason for profit from ill-gotten gains. 
Creating a placebo disease effect more damaging especially to mental health.</p>
	
<p>Going back in history, the discovery and use of Electricity, Radio, Telephone, TV, Cell Phones, Computers, and Internet!
Allowing for easy control of populaions and all markets by a few scam corporations without use of force.</p>

<p>In recent past in the industrial revolution they fought hard and defeated the mobs rule, slave labor, economic oppression, and poverty. Put in place laws to prevent these from reoccurring.
Going from the nazi communism political systems types of mob terrorist, to now mostly captilistic monopolies. 
Brutal dictatorships, but instead of using bodily force like the former, easily accomplish same result fleecing.</p>
	
<p>The coin based economic model probably began with the first civilizations as a means of fair trade for all.
Are now easily manupilated by powerful hegemonic monopolies control to profit while hurting everyone else.
These economic models have not been updated since beginning of time, are outdated in an age of electronics revolution. 
	Imagine life on EARTH with no Money in use anywhere. Money out lived its usefulness.
	LETS REMOVE MONEY COMPLETELY FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH.</p>
